// You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

// Example 1:

// Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
// Output: 3
// Example 2:

// Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
// Output: 0
